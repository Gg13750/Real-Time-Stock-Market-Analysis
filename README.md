## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
Create a new folder and save both files (`stock_sentiment_app.py` and `requirements.txt`) in it.

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv sentiment_env
```

### Step 3: Activate Virtual Environment
**Windows:**
```bash
sentiment_env\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source sentiment_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Download TextBlob Corpora (One-time setup)
```bash
python -m textblob.download_corpora
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated
2. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run stock_sentiment_app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8501`

## üí° How to Use

1. **Enter Stock Symbol**: In the sidebar, type any stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, MSFT)
2. **Select Time Period**: Choose analysis period (1 day, 5 days, 1 month, 3 months)
3. **View Results**: The app will automatically fetch data and display:
   - Current stock metrics
   - Price chart
   - Sentiment analysis of recent news
   - Overall sentiment score and distribution
